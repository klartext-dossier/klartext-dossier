## What is semi-structured text?

**Semi-structured** text is text that combines elements with a defined, formal structure (e.g., software requirements) with elements that have no defined structure (e.g., design descriptions).

There are a number of challenges with semi-structured text:

consistency
:   do it the same way all the time

flexibility
:   allow for deviations from the norm

maintainability
:   ensure changes are safe and simple

scalability
:   make it work with large amounts of text

## What is pythonic?

**Pythonic** is an adjective that describes an approach to computer programming that agrees with the founding philosophy of the Python programming language:

- **Beautiful** is better than ugly
- **Explicit** is better than implicit
- **Simple** is better than complex
- **Complex** is better than complicated
- **Flat** is better than nested
- **Sparse** is better than dense
- **Readability** counts
